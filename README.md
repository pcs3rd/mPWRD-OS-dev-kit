## Using mPWRD-OS

1. Flash the latest image from the build tool, using [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or a similar tool.
   - For boards with eMMC: Flash with `rkdevtool`. (Guide coming soon).
2. SSH into the device (or connect with Serial), login with default credentials. You will be prompted to change this upon first login.
3. Run `mpwrd-menu` to setup Meshtastic, change settings, and more!

## Using this repo

To get a image to flash to SDcard for the femtofox follow these directions. I use a Ubuntu 24.04 Virtual Image to follow the steps below.

1. Checkout `armbian/build` and enter the dir
```sh
git clone https://github.com/armbian/build.git
cd build
```

2. Checkout this repo as "userpatches"
```sh
git clone https://github.com/spudgunman/mPWRD-OS userpatches
```

3. Compile!
```sh
./compile.sh luckfox-pico-mini build KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no
```
This example will build the configuration at `config-luckfox-pico-mini.conf`

The output image will go into .. build/output/images

Once booted and system is setup radio is lit up and working..
- Edit the /opt/meshing-around/config.ini as needed 
- To install sercvice run from the /opt/meshing-around directory
  - `sudo bash etc/install_service.sh`

Your mPWRD-OS device should now be running meshing-around bot!
